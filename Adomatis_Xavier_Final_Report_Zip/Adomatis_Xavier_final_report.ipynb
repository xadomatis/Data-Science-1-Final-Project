    "The benefits of being in the financial system are limited; just by having a bank account, you gain access to meager interest rates and a variety of expensive financial services. The absence of costs incurred by having a bank account, however, are substantial. If one doesn't have a bank account, they're likely to spend hundreds in check cashing fees, subpar payday loans, or dealing with physical risks like theft and home fires. Increasing participation can increase household budgets substantially, especially for the low-income households disporportionatley affected by being unbanked."

    "Given the consequences of this issue, researchers at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, like myself, and others at banking agencies have sought to understand what determines being unbanked. FDIC economists Celerier and Matray, for instance, found that increasing bank diversity increases banking participation, especially for minorities (2014). Ebonya Washington at Yale attributed it to income disparities and poor public policy (2006). Michael Barr and Rebecca Blank indicated thay in addition to economic status, there are cultural factors ar play as well (2008). Other economists, like Rhine and Greene at the Federal Reserve, have looked at disporportionate effects on at-risk subgroups, like documented immigrants (2006). The broad conclusion of the literature is that there are broad and often intersectional issues with economic inclusivity that often disporportionatley effect vulnerable populations."

All models were run through a Machine learning pipline, which took our data and tested it on a variety of statistical models. Most results yielded a decision tree regressor, which takes our data, sorts by combinations, and establishes buckets in predicting the outcome. Decision tree models help split the data, and often can assess intersectionality. Since our dependent variable is only a yes or a no, as are most of the inputs, a decision tree already seems to fit well with the data. This is backed by underlying research, as most authors suggest intersectionality is a major determinant of being unbanked. However, the model also assessed fit with Random Forrests, Bagging, and K Nearest Neighbors, none of which were optimum with any version of my data. It also assessed linear models."
